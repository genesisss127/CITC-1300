                        <p>Gotham City is home to some of the most fearsome villains in comic book history. The Joker, Batman’s arch-nemesis, thrives on chaos and destruction. Bane, a physically formidable opponent, once broke Batman’s back in an infamous battle. The Riddler challenges Batman’s intellect with mind-bending puzzles and riddles. Catwoman, though sometimes an ally, has a criminal past that keeps her at odds with the Dark Knight. The Scarecrow uses fear as a weapon, deploying toxins that exploit the deepest terrors of his victims. Each villain presents a unique challenge, forcing Batman to constantly adapt his crime-fighting strategies.</p>

                        <p>One of Batman’s greatest advantages is his collection of high-tech gadgets. His utility belt contains Batarangs, smoke bombs, grappling hooks, and various other tools that aid him in battle. The Batmobile, one of the most iconic vehicles in comic book history, is equipped with advanced armor and weaponry. Batman also wears a specialized suit with reinforced Kevlar, night vision, and shock-resistant padding. His Batcomputer allows him to monitor Gotham from the Batcave, gathering intelligence on criminal activity. Over time, his technology has evolved, ensuring that he remains one step ahead of his enemies. These gadgets, combined with his training and strategy, make him one of the most formidable heroes in existence.</p>
