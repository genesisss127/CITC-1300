            <p>Batman is Gotham’s dark protector, a vigilante who fights crime using his intelligence, combat skills, and high-tech gadgets. Unlike other superheroes, he has no superpowers but relies on his intense training, detective skills, and fearsome presence. He is known for his moral code, refusing to kill even his worst enemies, which often leads to internal struggles. As the leader of the Bat-Family, he mentors allies like Robin and Batgirl, shaping them into crimefighters. His unwavering commitment to justice has earned him the respect of Gotham’s citizens and law enforcement. Despite his heroics, he is haunted by the tragedy of his parents’ murder, which fuels his relentless mission. Batman’s presence alone strikes fear into the hearts of criminals, making him one of the most formidable figures in Gotham.</p>

            <p>Bruce Wayne, Batman’s alter ego, is a billionaire philanthropist and the head of Wayne Enterprises. By day, he plays the role of a carefree playboy, masking his true identity as Gotham’s greatest detective. His wealth funds his crime-fighting efforts, allowing him to develop advanced technology and maintain the Batcave. Despite his public persona, Bruce is deeply affected by the loss of his parents, which drives his double life. He struggles with personal relationships, often pushing people away to protect them from his dangerous mission. His intelligence and business acumen make him a powerful figure, both in Gotham’s high society and on the battlefield against crime. Bruce Wayne is not just a mask for Batman but a crucial part of his identity, allowing him to operate within both worlds.</p>
