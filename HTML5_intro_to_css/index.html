        <h2>Who is Batman?</h2>
        <p>Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, is one of the most iconic superheroes in comic book history. After witnessing his parents' tragic murder as a child, he dedicated his life to fighting crime in Gotham City. Unlike other superheroes, Batman possesses no superpowers but relies on his intellect, detective skills, and advanced technology. His mission is to instill fear in criminals and protect innocent citizens. Batman operates in secrecy, using the Bat-Signal as his primary method of communication with the Gotham City Police Department. He maintains a strict moral code, refusing to kill even the worst criminals. His legacy as the "World’s Greatest Detective" has earned him respect across the DC Universe.</p>

        <h3>Batman’s Mission</h3>
        <p>Batman is more than just a crime-fighter; he is a symbol of justice and hope. Working from his hidden Batcave beneath Wayne Manor, he uses his wealth to fund his crime-fighting activities. He trains relentlessly, mastering various forms of martial arts, forensic science, and psychological warfare. His most trusted ally is Commissioner Jim Gordon, who helps him navigate Gotham’s corrupt justice system. Batman’s war on crime extends beyond the city, as he often joins forces with superheroes like Superman and Wonder Woman. Despite his immense dedication, Bruce Wayne struggles with the emotional burden of his double life. His greatest fear is failing Gotham and allowing criminals to take over.</p>

        <h3>Batman’s Allies</h3>
        <p>Although Batman is often seen as a lone vigilante, he has several trusted allies who assist him in his mission. Alfred Pennyworth, his loyal butler, provides emotional support, medical aid, and tactical guidance. Commissioner Jim Gordon is one of the few honest cops in Gotham, using the Bat-Signal to call for Batman’s help. The original Robin, Dick Grayson, eventually became Nightwing, forging his own path as a hero. Barbara Gordon, also known as Batgirl, fights alongside Batman while using her intellect and hacking skills as Oracle. In addition to his Gotham-based allies, Batman works with the Justice League, including heroes like Superman and Wonder Woman. These partnerships strengthen his mission, proving that even the Dark Knight sometimes needs backup.</p>
